                <p>Pinch pleats are very versatile. They are appropriate for a comfortably casual space, or they work well with traditional and elegant interiors. Pinch pleats never go out of style and are a great option.Pinched at the top, this type of header will create fuller pleats and a gathered look extending down the face of the curtains. You can use pockets or rings to hang them.</p>

                <img src="ima/rod.jpg" alt="rob" style="width:60%","height:50%">
                <p>The most classic and common of all methods of hanging curtains, a rod pocket is a sewn-in pocket, or casing, at the top of a curtain panel that easily slips over a rod and conceals it. Curtain panels hung this way bunch nicely and have a simple, casual look.</p>
